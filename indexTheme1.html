      <p>This Distro is not for everyone if you are new to Linux or consider yourself an average computer user, getting Arch Linux would be a nightmare for you. Arch is not just an operating system that you get it from an website, install it and start working on it.Itâ€™s a complete DIY project to built a custom machine for your specific requirement which is good for advance user or computer experts but may not be the best option for most computer users. It is not just about the installation only but the entire system require a lot of time & effort. It was developed by canadian developer judd vinet in 2001 . It was developed to address the package management issue with Linux Distro at that time and for this a new package management tool was built called Pacman,it is one of the fastest and efficient tool out there.The biggest reason for Arch immense popularity is the fact that it is the most bleeding edge Distro in the entire Linux World. Arch Linux are difficult to set up because they are born without an installation bundler. They are a bit like the original Linux system with its source code.The installation is so complicated & unlike any other OS you have ever done.There is no graphical installer to install Arch. Everything is command line so all the basic steps require to install an OS like Disk partitioning ,internet setting,selecting mirrors,working,boot loader etc. has to be done via command line. Arch is a sort of custom OS .You have built it each and every little software you have installed based on your hardware configuration and software requirement as a result of that your OS is different from other Arch system.Hence a particular software that works on a different Arch system may not be compatible with your Arch system. So you should ready to troubleshoot the system at your own. Arch has been there for a long time & online help is available. As i said you have built a custom system as per your requirement so there are very less chances to find the exact solution to your specific issue.</p>
